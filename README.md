# JUCE-FFT-Test
This is a basic implementation of a fast fourier transform that uses forward and inverse transforms with complex numbers.
GUI components are also added that allow the user to select a frequency they want to know the amplitude of and which tell the user the frequency that has the highest amplitude.

Simply build the project with the projucer.
